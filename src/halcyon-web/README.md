## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Halcyon API
  [https://github.com/chrispoulter/halcyon-api](https://github.com/chrispoulter/halcyon-api)

### Install dependencies

Install NPM packages:

```
npm install
```

### Configure environment variables

For local development, you'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project to define the environment variables. This file is ignored by Git, so the secrets will not be committed to the repository.

```
VERSION=1.0.0-local

API_URL=http://localhost:5257

JWT_SECURITY_KEY=super_secret_key_that_should_be_changed
JWT_ISSUER=HalcyonApi
JWT_AUDIENCE=HalcyonClient

SESSION_SECRET=super_secret_key_that_should_be_changed
```

### Running the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the project running.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized build in the `.next` folder.

## Linting & Formatting

To lint and format the code:

```
npm run lint
npm run format
```
